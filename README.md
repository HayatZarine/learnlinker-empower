 ## 📌 About the Project
LearnLinker Empower is a global educational platform designed to bring quality education to underprivileged children and marginalized women—especially those restricted from going outside due to societal norms or abuse. This initiative uses AI-powered matchmaking, real-time communication, and a secure, hidden learning mode to make learning accessible, safe, and personalized.
